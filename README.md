# text-to-vector
Turn your text into a vector of strings. (JavaScript Reference: String.split)

# Usage
```cpp
std::vector<string> splitted = txtToVector::split("Hello, I'm a string!", ' ');
// splitted: {"Hello,", "I'm", "a", "string!"}

Whatever character is on the second parameter is the character it will split by.
